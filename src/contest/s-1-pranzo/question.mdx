Tip-Tap has to prepare lunch and has lined up $N$ foods he wants to eat.
Each food is a vegetable or a fruit, and Tip-Tap only wants to eat **raw fruit** and **cooked vegetables**.
You have these blocks available:

  - `N`: the number of foods that Tip-Tap has lined up.
  - `next food`: the next food that Tip-Tap hasn't eaten yet.
  - $x$ `is a vegetable`: true if food $x$ is a vegetable.
  - `cook` $x$: cook food $x$.
  - `eat` $x$: eat food $x$.
  - `terminate`: stop eating.

Write a program that allows Tip-Tap to have lunch in the way he likes!
