## Section 1: quizzes

Yes, you can add sections (and other markdown explanation text) as you wish!
This is relevant for shuffling:
- only questions within the same section are shuffled;
- as you can see below, questions may be divided in sub-questions
  (and a group of sub-questions participate in the shuffling as a single entity);
- individual options within a question can also be shuffled;
- also, a question may have multiple variants (same question, different "numbers") to be chosen randomly.

It can be customised separately for each question how much points it is worth if:
- it is answered correctly (in this section, 5 points);
- it is not answered (in this section, 1 point);
- it is answered wrongly (in this section, 0 points).

Also, questions may be of different types (single choice, multiple choice, open ended).

<Section>
  <Problem points={[5, 1, 0]}><P1SaltoOstacoli /></Problem>
  <Problem points={[5, 1, 0]}><P2Spiedino /></Problem>
</Section>

## Section 2: block programming

QuizMS also supports block programming tasks. In those tasks, you have to write a **single** block program,
that will be evaluated on **multiple levels** (test cases). It can be customised for each question how
much points each level is worth if:
- it is answered correctly (in this test, 5 points);
- it is not answered, that is, there is no program (in this test, 0.5 points);
- it is answered wrongly (in this test, 0 points).
